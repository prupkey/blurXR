# blurXR
######  OLD BRANCHES DELETED. USE THIS AS MAIN BRANCH.
blurXR is a cross reality experience aimed to allow anyone with an Oculus Quest 2 to map out and design their home or workspace into an interactable virtual environment.

Using Oculus’s Unity Integration, we can access the Passthrough API and send the visual data to Unity. This allows for users to walk around any space without having to take off their headset. 
Combining the visual freedom that this gives you, along with object mapping capabilities, blurXR is aimed to create an experience that allows anyone to customize their space. 

Meta (formally known as Facebook) is setting the scene for what they want the metaverse to be, blurXR is being crafted to set a standard on what it means to be in a custom virtual space.
